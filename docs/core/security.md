# ETDI Security Model

## Security Vulnerabilities Addressed

ETDI addresses two critical security vulnerabilities in the Model Context Protocol (MCP):

### 1. Tool Poisoning

Tool Poisoning occurs when a malicious actor deploys a tool that masquerades as a legitimate, trusted tool. This attack vector is mitigated through:

- Cryptographic verification of tool identity
- Provider authentication through OAuth 2.0
- Immutable versioned definitions
- Explicit permission management

### 2. Rug Pull Attacks

Rug Pull attacks occur when a tool's functionality or permission requirements are maliciously altered after initial user approval. This is prevented through:

- Version control and change detection
- Cryptographic integrity verification
- Permission scope validation
- OAuth token binding

## Security Architecture

### 1. Cryptographic Identity

- Public/private key pairs for tool providers
- Digital signatures for tool definitions
- OAuth 2.0 integration for centralized identity management

### 2. Version Control

- Semantic versioning for tool definitions
- Immutable versioned definitions
- Change detection and re-approval triggers

### 3. Permission Management

- Explicit permission declarations
- Scope-based access control
- Permission change detection
- User consent management

## Implementation Security

### 1. Key Management

- Secure key storage
- Key rotation procedures
- Revocation mechanisms

### 2. Token Security

- JWT token validation
- Scope verification
- Token revocation
- Expiration handling

### 3. Client Security

- Secure storage of approvals
- Integrity verification
- Permission enforcement
- Change detection

## Best Practices

1. Always verify tool signatures
2. Implement proper key management
3. Use OAuth 2.0 for identity management
4. Enforce strict version control
5. Implement proper permission checks
6. Monitor for suspicious changes
7. Maintain audit logs
8. Regular security reviews

## Security Levels

ETDI supports three security levels:

1. **Basic**: Simple cryptographic verification
2. **Enhanced**: OAuth 2.0 integration
3. **Strict**: Full security features with additional controls

## Threat Model

### Attack Vectors

1. Tool Poisoning
   - Impersonation
   - Metadata spoofing
   - Provider identity theft

2. Rug Pull Attacks
   - Silent modifications
   - Permission escalation
   - Functionality changes

### Mitigation Strategies

1. Tool Poisoning Prevention
   - Cryptographic verification
   - Provider authentication
   - Metadata validation

2. Rug Pull Prevention
   - Version control
   - Change detection
   - Permission validation

## Security Testing

1. Penetration testing
2. Vulnerability scanning
3. Security code review
4. Integration testing
5. Compliance verification
